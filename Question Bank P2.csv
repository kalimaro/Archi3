37,"QUESTION NO: 218 \n \nScenario  You are working as a consultant to the Chief Architect at a government agency responsible for\nsecuring all government communications and information systems. The agency has recently\nreceived funding for a program that will upgrade the reliability and performance of its secure\ncommunication systems which provide real-time, highly secure communication of voice, video, and\nmessage data to remote locations around the world.\n \n \nThe agency has an established enterprise architecture (EA) capability based on TOGAF 9. The\nExecutive Director of the agency is the sponsor of the EA capability.\n \n \nSince reliable, high-performance, and secure communications are essential to preserving national\nsecurity, the Executive Director has placed more stringent requirements for the architecture for the\nupgraded system. It must be able to provide assurance and verification of specific performance\nmeasures on the key services that are most crucial for system operation. Focusing on these\nservice-level details and specific measurements will allow more stringent requirements to be\nenforced in service contracts. It will also provide a high degree of assurance that necessary\nperformance is being delivered and that notifications will occur if any critical service fails to\nperform as required.\n \n \nA portion of the program budget has been allocated to context a review of the EA. The scope of\nthe review is to evaluate the processes, content and governance of the EA capability to ensure\nthat the higher target performance and service levels required by the upgraded system can be\nachieved.\n \n \nThe Chief Architecture has noted that the core EA artifacts that have been used since TOGAF 9\nwas introduced are not adequate to describe these new capabilities. The artifacts do not have\nexplicit provisions for defining the in-depth measurement requirements regarding specific services\nrequired for the system. She has learned that certain services within the current system have\nservice measurement implementations that match some of the new requirements, but they are\nonly used in a few areas.\n \n \nRecent EA efforts at another national agency have produced generalized high-performance\ncommunication system models to realize similar requirements in a critical defense system\ninvolving secure communications. It is possible that these models may be useful for the upgrade\n 124program.\n \n \nRefer to the Scenario\n \nYou have been asked to make recommendations for tailoring the Architecture Content Metamodel\nto accommodate the requirements of the upgraded system.\n \nBased on TOGAF, which of the following is the best answer?\n \n \n","A. Since some artifacts will now require specific measurements and additional data will be needed\nto support the performance objectives linked to these measurements, you recommend that the\nmotivation and governance extensions of the TOGAF 9 Content Metamodel are used. Using these\nextensions will allow modeling the goals, objectives and drivers for the architecture, linking them to\nservice levels and more detailed governance models. This will also enable the ability to re-use\nexisting profiles, customizing them for the various service contracts involved. \n","B. You recommend all of the TOGAF 9 Content Metamodel extensions be incorporated into the\nArchitecture Content Metamodel. The full Content Metamodel will enable the EA team to capture\nand categorize all the important additional data needs to support the performance and\nmeasurement objectives linked to these artifacts. Once the new repository content has been\nimplemented, on- demand queries can be used to generate a customized governance stakeholder\nview that isolates the artifacts and data needed to assess measurement for any particular service.\nIf this view is found to be inadequate for the governance concerns, the service models within those\nartifacts can be expanded. \n","C. Since this case requires extensions of the modeling and data details of the service, this is best\ndone by using the services extension of the TOGAF 9 Content Metamodel. By using this\nextension, the service model is no longer constrained by what is expected in typical business\nservice definitions, allowing more flexibility for adding customized models to support the more\nstringent measurement requirements. The services extension can also be used to map\nterminology between the business services and the application components. \n","D. To support the type of stringent performance measurements needed for the more detailed\ngovernance views required for the upgraded system, the interfaces to the communication and\nnetwork layer of the architecture must be highly visible at the application level. To accommodate\nthe proper development of this, a Communications Engineering view should be created from the\ninfrastructure extension models of the TOGAF Content Metamodel. This view will allow architects\nto align the required performance measurement communications across the system. \n \n",A,Explanation:

Collectively, they\npossess a broad range of IT and business analysis skills. However, the CIO has expressed\nconcern about the diverse range of experience within the team. There is concern that the EA staff\nmay be lacking in some of the critical skills that are required to properly conduct EA activities. It\nhad been assumed that any EA-related skill gaps would be overcome by on-the-job mentoring\nfrom the senior members of the EA staff. Each architect was expected to attend a TOGAF training\ncourse and participate in other skill development activities.\n \n \nA recent review of the EA program revealed that many EA staff members, despite attending multi-\nday training courses, were not proficient in analyzing or creating the models and artifacts required\nfor their assigned architecture projects.

You recommend that a comprehensive evaluation of key team leader skills be made using the\nTOGAF Architecture Skills Framework. Based on the evaluations, you will recommend the\nnecessary staff changes. This will ensure that the team leaders have the necessary skills and\nexperience for the architecture tasks within the agency.

You recommend that you work with the EA steering team to adapt the TOGAF Architecture\nSkills Framework for use within the architecture practice at the agency. The categories of\narchitecture roles, the required skills for each role and the desired level of proficiency for each role\nand skill will be defined by this framework. Each team member, or prospective team member, can\nthen be evaluated for suitability against these roles and skills. Staffing and training adjustments\ncan then be made as necessary to close gaps that are discovered. \n","D. You recommend that to address the issues identified in the review, the experienced team\nleaders should mentor the junior team members. At the same time additional training should be\nprovided. Since it is now known that some models are improperly defined and may have caused\ncascading errors in other parts of the architecture, you recommend an iteration of the Migration\nPlanning phase occur, so as to develop a coordinated transition to a new baseline using the last\nknown good architecture.
